The tool automatically extracts the target endpoint, headers, and body from the request file ‚Äî allowing you to replay traffic exactly as Burp Suite captured it.

If Burp Suite is set up to listen on a proxy (e.g., 127.0.0.1:8080) and is configured to forward traffic through a SOCKS proxy (such as an SSH tunnel), your requests will seamlessly be visible in Burp without any extra flags.

## üì• Installation  
You can install the tool directly using `go install`:  

```sh
go install github.com/ScarlyCodex/graphql-auth-tester@latest
```

Make sure `$HOME/go/bin/` is in your `$PATH`:
```sh
export PATH=$HOME/go/bin:$PATH
```

To do this permanently, you can add it to your `.bashrc` or `.zshrc`:
```sh
echo 'export PATH=$HOME/go/bin:$PATH' >> ~/.zshrc
source ~/.zshrc
```

## Usage
Once you have detected a request to a GraphQL endpoint, run `graphql-auth-tester --help`. 
- ‚ö†Ô∏è The `request.txt` must be in Burp Suite's format.
- Use `-r` to specify the path to your raw HTTP request file, e.g.:
  ```sh
  graphql-auth-tester -r request.txt
  ```
- Use `-t` to define the delay between each request in seconds (default is 1).
  ```sh
  graphql-auth-tester -r request.txt -t 2
  ```
This delay helps avoid rate-limiting or detection during testing by spreading out the requests.
Set it to 0 if you want the fastest possible execution (‚ö†Ô∏è not recommended on production targets).

If you want to perform unauthenticated checks, make sure to remove the neccesary headers e.g `Cookie:` || `Authorization:`. 

Finally:
```sh
graphql-auth-tester -r request.txt -t 7
```

### Note
As always, this tool could give false-positives since there could be tricky mutations which have to send very specific values.
