# üî• GraphQL Authorization Tester  

### üöÄ Description  
GraphQL Authorization Tester is a tool that automates the testing of GraphQL mutations to determine whether they are allowed or restricted.  

‚úÖ **Features:**  
- Discover all available mutations.  
- Identify allowed and forbidden mutations.  
- Works with any GraphQL endpoint.  
- Easy to install and use.

## üì• Installation  
You can install the tool directly using `go install`:  

```sh
go install github.com/ScarlyCodex/graphql-auth-tester@latest
```

Make sure `$HOME/go/bin/` is in your `$PATH`:
```sh
export PATH=$HOME/go/bin:$PATH
```

To do this permanently, you can add it to your `.bashrc` or `.zshrc`:
```sh
echo 'export PATH=$HOME/go/bin:$PATH' >> ~/.zshrc
source ~/.zshrc
```

## Usage
Once you have detected a request to a GraphQL endpoint, run `graphql-auth-tester --help`. 
- ‚ö†Ô∏è The `request.txt` must be in Burp Suite's format.

If you want to perform unauthenticated checks, make sure to remove the neccesary headers e.g `Cookie:` || `Authorization:`. 

Finally:
```sh
graphql-auth-tester -r request.txt -t 7
```

### Note
As always, this tool could give false-positives since there could be tricky mutations which have to send very specific values.
